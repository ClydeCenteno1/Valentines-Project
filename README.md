A fully responsive, interactive web-based coupon book designed as a digital gift. This project replaces paper coupons with a modern UI, allowing the user to select and "redeem" rewards (like a dinner date or movie night) via interactive modal popups.

## 🌟 Features

* **Responsive Grid Layout:** Built with Bootstrap 5 to look perfect on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
* **Interactive Modals:** "Redeem" buttons trigger unique popups for each specific coupon.
* **Custom Design:** Features a "Cotton Candy" gradient theme (`linear-gradient`) and handwritten typography (Pacifico font).
* **Animations:** CSS hover effects on cards for a tactile feel.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling, gradients, and animations.
* **Bootstrap 5.3:** For the responsive grid system and modal components.
* **FontAwesome:** For vector icons (Utensils, Film, Hands, etc.).
* **Google Fonts:** Typography (*Pacifico* for headers, *Quicksand* for body text).
